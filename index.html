          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/xTVFHaL.png" alt="Sudoku board">
          <p class="project-synopsis">I wrote the logic behind a sudoku solver in JavaScript then wrote post
            logic for solving and checking answers on a Node/Express application server. You can input your
            own board state and have the options to either solve the board based on your prompt, or check values for
            specific input and receive instant feedback on if it is a valid answer.</p>

          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/S5ivt7H.png" alt="Survey form">
          <p class="project-synopsis">This was a project I did early on to practice HTML and CSS.
            It is a simple sample survey using form, radio buttons, text area, and drop down menus.</p>

        <a class="project-tile" href="https://github.com/BenKemp95/freecodecamp_treemap">
          <p class="project-description">Tree-map Data Visualization</p>
          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/E8vc0tG.png" alt="Tree-map graphic">
          <p class="project-synopsis"> I was given three JSON object links and tasked with visualizing one of
            them by making a tree-map scaled to the values of the data in the objects. I created a dynamic
            graph that you can interact with by hovering your mouse over entries to receive more information.
            I also made it so that you could toggle between the three different JSON objects to look at maps of
            each JSON Object and the tree-map would dynamically change to fit the new data.</p>

          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/haBvOs8.png" alt="Technical Information page">
          <p class="project-synopsis">This was a project designed to practice HTML and CSS elements. It is a single page with anchored
          links to the different title elements of the page.</p>

          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZNpG9vc.png" alt="URL shortener">
          <p class="project-synopsis">Using Node and Express with MongoDB, I wrote code that posts user
            input URLs into a database, and returns a shortened URL back to the user that they can then
            use to go to the original URL location. I accounted for redundancy and made sure that if a duplicate
            URL was entered by a user, they would receive the already existing database entry rather than creating
            another entry to keep the database organized.</p>

        <a class="project-tile" href="https://github.com/BenKemp95/freeCodeCamp_American_British_Translator">
          <p class="project-description">American-British Translator</p>
          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/4oky5qj.png" alt="American-British Translator">
          <p class="project-synopsis">Using several objects of key value pairs that show an American spelling or
            version of a word or phrase and then its British counterpart, I wrote the logic to translate a user input
            string into the opposite version. The starting key value pairs ranged from one word phrases to multiple
            word phrases, so I had to account for that when searching for matching phrases from the database to translate.</p>

        <a class="project-tile" href="https://github.com/BenKemp95/freeCodeCamp_build_a_drum_machine">
          <p class="project-description">Drum Machine in React</p>
          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/nGbw0hw.png" alt="Drum Machine">
          <p class="project-synopsis">For this project I was given nine links that each had a sound element and told to make
          an interactive drum machine that would play back each sound when clicked or the corresponding key was pushed. I build it in
            React JavaScript using multiple different states, useEffects, and useRef. When playing back each sound, the name of the sound
          will be displayed for the user to see.</p>

          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/rxm9E64.png" alt="Calculator">
          <p class="project-synopsis">I made a JavaScript Calculator in React that can do all basic calculator math functions. If you
          chain math functions, it will keep the working calculation of the previous entry and solve based on that. You can accurately use decimals
          and negative numbers, and even change what math function you had entered if you clicked the wrong one by mistake.</p>

          <img class="project-preview" src="https://i.imgur.com/QZgimcn.png" alt="USA map">
          <p class="project-synopsis">Using the visualization language D3 in JavaScript, I used a linked JSON object to create an interactive
          map of the United States that showed the education density of each state.</p>
